# CS 110 Midterm Exam

## Description
A house drawing made by using Turtle commands. The user is asked if they want to build a house. If so, the user has the ability to customize the various components of the house (color and whether or not the component is drawn).

## Known Bugs and Incomplete Parts
Nope.

## REFERENCES:

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS:
-If "Y" or "N" is not entered during a yes or no question, the program must be restarted. This is intentional.

-If "Y" is selected to build the the house, but "N" is selected when asking for each individual component of the house, the house will not be built.

-Later parts of the house can be built even if the part before was not chosen to be built.
